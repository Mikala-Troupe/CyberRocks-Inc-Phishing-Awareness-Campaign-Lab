# CyberRocks-Inc-Phishing-Awareness-Campaign

# Lab: CyberRocks Inc. Anti-Phishing Awareness and Training Campaign

This project showcases the design and implementation of a company-wide **Phishing Awareness Campaign** at **CyberRocks Inc.** to reduce phishing incidents, strengthen employee awareness, and improve the organization’s overall cybersecurity posture.
It follows the **ADDIE instructional design model (Analyze, Design, Develop, Implement, Evaluate)** and demonstrates practical application of **security awareness, behavioral psychology, and incident prevention strategies**.

## 🧠 Objective

The goal of this project was to:

* Reduce phishing click rates among employees
* Increase phishing report submissions
* Improve employee awareness of social-engineering tactics
* Create a sustainable, security-focused culture

The campaign trained employees to identify and report phishing attempts while reinforcing these behaviors through interactive simulations.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Resources Used

* **Microsoft 365 / Outlook** – for phishing simulations and reporting
* **Custom “Report Phish” Button** – integrated into employee inboxes
* **Canva / PowerPoint** – posters, digital reminders, and visuals
* **Zoom / Loom** – video recording and live training sessions
* **SurveyMonkey** – pre- and post-campaign assessments
* **Internal LMS** – to deliver monthly awareness modules

---

## ⚙️ Steps Taken

### 1. Analyze

* Reviewed past phishing incidents and employee click data
* Conducted a baseline knowledge survey via HR
* Identified key training gaps and behavioral weaknesses

### 2. Design

* Planned training content using the **ADDIE framework**
* Created a campaign schedule and simulation timeline
* Designed realistic phishing templates for internal testing

### 3. Develop

* Produced short **training videos**, **quizzes**, and **guides**
* Created **posters** and **digital signage** to reinforce awareness
* Built and tested the **“Report Phish”** button for all mail clients

### 4. Implement

* Hosted a kickoff event introducing the new phishing campaign
* Deployed monthly micro-lessons via the LMS
* Conducted controlled **phishing simulations**
* Rolled out the **Report Phish** tool and encouraged usage
* Monitored participation and response metrics

### 5. Evaluate

* Re-surveyed employees and reviewed post-campaign results
* Compared click-rate reduction and reporting frequency
* Collected feedback for future awareness improvements

## ⚠️ Challenges (Scope Creep)

* **Design Phase:** Needed simpler visuals and plainer language for non-technical staff.
* **Button Compatibility:** Older Outlook versions required extra testing and fixes.

Although these caused slight delays, both improvements made the final campaign stronger and more user-friendly.
